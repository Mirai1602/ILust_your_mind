            i started darwing since a young age and over time i've improved my skills, I developed 
            a great technic and style in digital and tradicional illustrating, i think. i almost focus
             myself on drawing people and that stuff but i feel comfortable doing other things. My main tool for 
             digital painting it's my phone with the illustration program ibisPaint X and for traditional I use 
             more graphite pencil, but i'm learning how to watercolor, markers, chalks a
            nd that things. I hope to keep improving in it.

            I have been drawing since I was little, but from the age of 7 I began to take
             drawing more seriously. I am a traditional artist and I like to explore many drawing 
            styles and my comfort zone is characters, mostly women.
